# Demo Prediction

This repo helps future users recreate the model and test it against future implementations.

## Dependencies

DeepForest uses conda environments to manage python dependencies. For this prediction example, the requirements are

* OpenCV
* Keras + Tensorflow
* Numpy
* Matplotlib

Clone the fork of the retinanet repo and install in local environment

```
git clone https://github.com/bw4sz/keras-retinanet
cd keras-retinanet
pip install .
```

# Sample Model

I've hosted a sample model here for quick prototyping. This model was trained on the Mixed Pine (TEAK) site.
